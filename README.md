greyreset
=========

A combined CSS reset and normalizer that includes some utility classes. 

This is my go-to reset script. It is thus personalised towards the way I tend to do things and might not be for you—and that's fine. This code is not a catch-all, and you'll probably end up cutting or adding a few rules here and there to suit your specific project—and you should be! There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.
